# Weed Detection and Geolocation App

1)A **Streamlit**-based web application for detecting and geolocating weeds in **georeferenced orthomosaic GeoTIFF images** (e.g., from drone surveys).  
2)The app uses a **YOLOv8** model to process large images tile-by-tile, extract weed locations, and export a **Shapefile** with precise GPS coordinates.  
3)This tool is designed for **precision agriculture**, enabling farmers and researchers to map weeds for **spot spraying** and **field analysis**.

## Features
- **Upload** `.tif` / `.tiff` georeferenced orthomosaic imagery.
- **YOLOv8-based detection** on tiled images for large raster handling.
- **Automatic GPS conversion** from UTM to WGS84.
- **Export Shapefile** of detections for use in GIS software.
- **Interactive visualization** overlaying detections on the orthomosaic and important KPIs like weed density etc.
- Currently supports **grass weeds** only (common ragweed, Palmer amaranth, and common lambsquarters coming soon).

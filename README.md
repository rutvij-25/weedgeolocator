# 🌱 Weed Detection and Geolocation App

A **Streamlit**-based web application for detecting and geolocating weeds in **georeferenced orthomosaic TIFF images** (e.g., from drone surveys).  
The app uses a **YOLOv8** model to process large images tile-by-tile, extract weed locations, and export a **shapefile** with precise GPS coordinates.

This tool is designed for **precision agriculture**, enabling farmers and researchers to map weeds for **spot spraying** and **field analysis**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Upload** `.tif` / `.tiff` georeferenced orthomosaic imagery
- 🤖 **YOLOv8-based detection** on tiled images for large raster handling
- 🌍 **Automatic GPS conversion** from UTM to WGS84
- 🗂 **Export shapefile** of detections for use in GIS software
- 📊 **Interactive visualization** overlaying detections on the orthomosaic
